## GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

This repository includes a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that provides:

### üîç Code Quality & Validation
- **HTML Validation**: Uses HTMLHint to validate HTML structure and best practices
- **CSS Linting**: Uses Stylelint with standard configuration for CSS code quality
- **JavaScript Linting**: Uses ESLint to catch JavaScript errors and enforce coding standards

### üîí Security Scanning
- **Trivy Scanner**: Scans for security vulnerabilities and uploads results to GitHub Security tab
- **SARIF Integration**: Security findings are integrated into GitHub's security dashboard

### üß™ Browser Testing
- **Playwright Tests**: Cross-browser testing on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- **E2E Testing**: Comprehensive end-to-end tests covering:
  - Login form functionality
  - Registration form validation
  - User authentication flow
  - Form switching and navigation
  - Error handling scenarios

### üöÄ Deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages on main branch pushes
- **Staging**: Pull requests trigger validation without deployment

### ‚ö° Performance Monitoring
- **Lighthouse CI**: Automated performance, accessibility, and SEO audits
- **Performance Reports**: Generated after each deployment

### Workflow Triggers
- **Push**: Triggers on pushes to `main` or `master` branches
- **Pull Request**: Validates code quality and runs tests on pull requests

The workflow ensures code quality, security, and functionality before any deployment, providing confidence in the application's reliability.
